## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deepsphere/deepsphere-cosmo-tf2.git
   cd deepsphere-cosmo-tf2
   ```

2. Install the package (including dependencies)
   ```sh
   pip install -e .
   ```
   **Note**: the code has been developed and tested with Python 3.10.
   It **does not** work on Python 2.7!

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Notebooks

The below notebooks contain examples and experiments to play with the model.

1. [Quick Start.][whole_sphere]
   The easiest to play with the model by classifying data on the whole sphere.
2. [Advanced Tutorial.][advanced]
   An introduction to various layers, customized training loops, and custom survey masks.
3. [Generative Models.][generative]
   How to build an auto-encoder using spherical data and the transpose healpy pseudo convolutions.
